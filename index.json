[{"content":"The catastrophic unravelling of cryptocurrency over the last year has been a sight to behold over the previous year. The perfect storm of FOMO, greed, a deafening lack of regulation and continuous and constant predatory behaviour (and people) has taken a novel concept into a \u0026rsquo;too big to fail\u0026rsquo; zero-sum game which is now starting to fail.\nZero Sum Game #Cryptocurrency had been hailed as a \u0026ldquo;revolutionary\u0026rdquo; new technology that would change the way we transact and store value. In reality, it has become a breeding ground for scams, fraud, and corruption. Despite its original promise of decentralization, transparency, and freedom from government control, cryptocurrency has become dominated by centralized exchanges, speculative trading, and other forms of manipulation.\nThe catastrophic unravelling of cryptocurrency over the last year has been a sight to behold over the previous year. The perfect storm of FOMO, greed, a deafening lack of regulation and continuous and constant predatory behaviour (and people) has taken a novel concept into a \u0026rsquo;too big to fail\u0026rsquo; zero-sum game which is now starting to fail.\nCryptocurrency is a zero-sum game, meaning that the value of a particular coin or token is determined by the collective actions of all the participants in the market, with any gain by one person being balanced by an equal loss by someone else. Cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value, and it does not have any inherent worth or usefulness.\nThe current state of cryptocurrency is a perfect example of the greater fool theory, where people are willing to pay more for an asset than its intrinsic value because they believe they can sell it to someone else at an even higher price. The conclusion of the greater fool theory is that investors who rely on this approach are likely to suffer significant losses when the market reaches a saturation point. Unfortunately for crypto, it seems that there may be no longer any \u0026ldquo;greater fools\u0026rdquo; willing to pay higher prices for the assets.\nMarket Goes Boom # \u0026ldquo;Due to market conditions, we\u0026rsquo;ve temporarily freezed withdrawals\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;\n~ Celsius, Voyager, FTX, Hodlnaut, Vauld, Gemini\nCryptocurrency was supposed to be decentralized and free from government control. Still, the difficulty of trading has led to the creation of centralized exchanges (such as Celsius, FTX, etc.) that took depositor funds and lent them to others for a profit - this is banking, but this time it\u0026rsquo;s unregulated. These crypto banks\u0026rsquo; existence wholly defeated cryptocurrency\u0026rsquo;s original purpose by introducing a centralized and \u0026ldquo;trusted\u0026rdquo; party.\nThe ongoing implosion of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is the conclusion of the practical application of the greater fool theory. The sharp drop in prices in early 2022 was like a child kicking the foundation of a castle made of sand and technical jargon, causing it to come crashing down. The sharp drop in prices shattered the illusion that the market would only ever go up and led to a massive chain reaction of significant players going bankrupt. If you were invested in Bitcoin 5 years ago, you would now be down 13%.\nLine go down In June 2022, Terra (an exchange) had its \u0026lsquo;algorithmic stable coin\u0026rsquo; (paradoxical) lose its dollar peg crashing to $1.999967e-7, that\u0026rsquo;s a millionth of a dollar. A stable coin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset (e.g. a USD), and people may have invested in them because they believed they offered a safer (it didn\u0026rsquo;t) and more predictable alternative to other cryptocurrencies (it wasn\u0026rsquo;t).\nTerra Luna\u0026rsquo;s collapse, in turn, caused 3 Arrows Capital, Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, Hodlnaut, Vauld, and FTX, to go bust in quick succession. Regrettably, this resulted in massive losses for the customers of those entities. Many of these people were likely unsophisticated investors lured in by promises of \u0026lsquo;going to the moon\u0026rsquo;.\nAt the time of writing, many other exchanges look \u0026lsquo;shaky\u0026rsquo;, with some shakier than others. It\u0026rsquo;s going to get worse.\nGood Riddance #I\u0026rsquo;m guilty of buying into the novelty of cryptocurrency in its early heyday, but now I see that it has become something different from what it was supposed to be.\nCryptocurrency in its state is an anthesis to its original concept, rife with shady and dodgy market players and scams, fraud and corruption. It\u0026rsquo;s long overdue to die. Additionally, it\u0026rsquo;s been over a decade since the \u0026ldquo;financial revolution\u0026rdquo; was meant to occur, and the only things that can be reliably bought with cryptocurrency are drugs and fake hitmen.\nThis post did not even touch on the cancer that is NFTs, but I highly recommend Dan Olson\u0026rsquo;s documentary Line Goes Up - The Problem with NFTs. There is also the fun fact that one of the largest NFT collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club, is filled to the brim with white supremacist dog whistles (whoops).\nLastly, how great would it be to stop having to hear crypto lingo finally?\n","date":"6 December 2022","permalink":"/posts/good-riddance-cryptocurrency/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe catastrophic unravelling of cryptocurrency over the last year has been a sight to behold over the previous year.

The value of vaccination should be self-evident to anyone with even a shred of common sense.\nIn this post, I explain why getting vaccinated isn’t just important—it’s essential, and refusing to do so is both reckless and selfish.\nThe purpose of this post is for me to articulate the way I explain to others why vaccines are necessary. Unfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed a growing trend of blatant misinformation, misunderstanding or maliciousness from people in general and a small minority of people/acquaintances that I know. Whether maliciously or not, if you know somebody in this category, I hope some of the diagrams or writing in this post helps you.\nInfection Probabilities vs. Population Vaccinated #The majority of the country understands this and are already behind getting vaccinated - however, you have a small minority which could potentially ruin things for everyone.\nThe example that I use to explain why vaccines are necessary is straightforward:\nThis graph shows the probability of getting n infected out of the ten bar patrons. The different lines show different vaccine scenarios. E.g. A wholly unvaccinated population has a 0% chance of having less than seven out of ten patrons becoming infected. In 2018, 15.2% of the New Zealand population was 65 or older. CDC has stated that you are 90 times more likely to die if you have COVID and are over 65.\nIf we treat our hypothetical bar as a sample of the New Zealand population, only in the 90% population vaccination scenario would we have a fighting chance of avoiding deaths in these older age brackets.\nTalking Points and How to Counter Them #In this section, I\u0026rsquo;ve listed down the main arguments I often hear being repeated. These arguments sometimes occur sequentially after being debunked, or they may be obfuscated with other red herrings. However, in general, I find these as the most common.\nWhy Should I If Everyone Else Is? #Getting the population vaccinated helps stop the spread of COVID-19, but vaccinations do not give total immunity to the virus. It only reduces the chance of transmission (and severity of symptoms if contracted). Every person who does not get vaccinated adds to the pool of infectious people in the community, potentially infecting others (even those vaccinated).\nYou can also point out having this stance is incredibly selfish.\nForcing Me to Vaccinate Infringes on My Freedom #This idea of a \u0026ldquo;loss of freedom\u0026rdquo; is most likely the unfortunate consequence/symptom of the American media machine slowly influencing New Zealand in the worst possible way. In a civilised society, the personal freedoms we enjoy come with strings; these strings are doing the right thing for the collective good.\nI found this quote online, and I think it articulates the subject far better than I could.\n\u0026ldquo;The government shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be telling us what to do,\u0026rdquo; they say, as their WOF-certified car rolls to a stop at a red light on their way to their MBIE-protected jobs.\n\u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re not in charge of my health,\u0026rdquo; they continue as they chomp into their NZFS-rated bagel with the confidence of one who knows it won\u0026rsquo;t send them to the taxpayer-funded hospital, but even if it did, the hospital has to treat them regardless of funds thanks to MOH policy.\n\u0026ldquo;We deserve the freedom to make our own choices,\u0026rdquo; they conclude, as the green light flicks on to inform them they can go. \u0026ldquo;\u0026amp;$*# you, eco-!@$#!\u0026rdquo; They curse at a nearby bicyclist for swaying a bit too close to their bonnet.\nVaccines Are Dangerous #Many people have valid health issues and concerns which prohibit them from getting the vaccination. The people who cannot get vaccinated will be protected most by a highly vaccinated population. That\u0026rsquo;s why it makes it so much worse that some people erroneously (intentional or not) use this as their excuse for why they will not get vaccinated.\nCDC\u0026rsquo;s reaction and adverse events register has catalogued the number of severe adverse reactions caused by the Pfizer vaccine. Out of the 7,851 doses given (all age groups \u0026gt; 12), there were 0 \u0026ldquo;Grade 4\u0026rdquo; events, these are the events that would require you to be hospitalised.\nThe proportions of participants who reported at least 1 serious adverse event were 0.4% in the vaccine group and 0.2% in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were considered by FDA as possibly related to vaccine.\nYou are more likely to get into a car crash than getting a severe reaction to the vaccine.\nConclusion #Get vaccinated.\n","date":"30 October 2021","permalink":"/posts/vaccinations-matter/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFew things frustrate me more than seeing anti-lockdown protestors, anti-vaxxers, or those who believe that vaccines somehow infringe upon their personal freedoms.

My primary motivator for doing this was my perceived lack of flexibility of Hugo, which was the lack of flexibility outside of written content.\nI let it run for a couple of months before I decided the other day that I\u0026rsquo;d had enough and reverted to my Hugo blog.\nThe Challenge #I went with a Django (with DRF) backend, React (with RTK) frontend, and PostgreSQL for this particular project - this combination is probably my project favourite stack. With a little bit of tweaking, you can get a project up and running in no time at all. While I love this project stack, this experience has taught me a valuable lesson. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution.\nArchitecture #An application made with React can be incredibly dynamic and flexible. Still, one of its biggest problems is that it is an incredible pain in the ass to do the SEO and performance comparable to that of a static page.\nServer-side rendering (SSR) becomes a necessity when you dynamically set meta tags for your content; this means that the minimum architecture you would need to deploy a React CMS/blog is as follows:\nThe application flow works out to be something like this:\nA user requests to visit a page NGINX routes the request to the relevant parts of the application The React SSR needs to render the React page and relevant meta tags before returning it to the user. The SSR requests the metadata from the backend. The metadata is retrieved from the backend and injected into the HTML response. Both the backend and SSR return their respective responses to NGINX. NGINX routes through the appropriate reverse proxy, and the user receives the rendered page. If it looks overly complicated, that\u0026rsquo;s because it is. In hindsight, I may have over-engineered this, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t develop another way to make this reliably work. If someone smarter than me has an easier way to achieve what I was trying to do, please reach out to me and let me know.\nWhen I checked the website on Google to see how it performed, it performed awfully. Too many things were happening behind the scenes, which resulted in sluggish performance. It\u0026rsquo;s just not comparable to a static page where all the content is ready to go.\nOther Issues #Beyond performance, there are other costs to doing this approach, making the whole thing even more unappealing. Depending on your stance and preferences, you may consider me unreasonable here, but hear me out.\nDeployment Overhead #Naturally, having a Django/React application was more resource-intensive in regards to deployment. I self-host my applications, so the cost, in this case, was not monetary. Instead, it was the administrative overhead of deploying this project. In this case, we have even more overhead than a standard Django/React application as we need to worry about the SSR element of the project.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s tough to compete with the almost no-overhead static pages type blog, especially when paired with something like GitHub pages which makes the process almost braindead.\nIn my case, when I want to make changes to the blog, I execute a simple shell script:\n#!/bin/bash shopt -s extglob cd marzukia.github.io/ git checkout master rm -rv !(\u0026#34;CNAME\u0026#34;|\u0026#34;.git/\u0026#34;) cd .. hugo cd marzukia.github.io/ git add . git commit -m \u0026#39;deploy changes\u0026#39; git push cd .. cd themes/salt git add . git commit -m \u0026#39;deploy changes\u0026#39; git push cd ../.. git add . git commit -m \u0026#39;new post or changes\u0026#39; git push As soon as I execute the script, it\u0026rsquo;ll run Hugo to build the static pages, recursively go into each submodule I have associated with the project, push changes, and we\u0026rsquo;re good to go. While in general, I would not consider the deployment overhead a factor, given the alternative is so easy, it becomes a pretty material consideration.\nOngoing Development \u0026amp; Maintenance #Why start a project if you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to maintain it? Having an application that has a backend, frontend and database will, of course, require more love and attention than a static page which is just HTML and CSS. This complaint seems like a stupid thing to whinge about, but given the purpose of my blog, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t justify it.\nMy blog serves two purposes for me:\nThe blog acts as a diary of sorts to help me crystalise my thoughts and retrospectively review things I\u0026rsquo;ve done. The blog acts as a tool to help me build and maintain a social media presence in the industry. Ultimately, it came back to \u0026ldquo;this is not worth it\u0026rdquo; for me.\nWhy Do It? #I\u0026rsquo;ve been fairly negative in this article, but I did allude to having reasons for doing this in the first place.\nDynamic Pages \u0026amp; Data #I absolutely love creating exciting data visualisations and tools. One significant benefit of building the project in Django/React meant that I had a much more sophisticated toolset to work with in terms of the content I could produce. The tool that I had packaged with the release of my React blog was a game-price finder that analysed scraped data from Wata Games/Heritage Auctions.\nNote: This tool will be down at the time of writing, but I\u0026rsquo;ll look at rebuilding it without the blog component. Also, you can find the aforementioned article here.\nI will make standalone applications in the future rather than trying to have it all unified as a single experience.\nGood Practice \u0026amp; Self Reflection #I recently discovered RTK Query this year, and I love it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had much time to explore the full capabilities, so I thought this project would be great practice.\nAnother huge thing for me was the opportunity to self-reflect on the progress I\u0026rsquo;ve made as a developer. Every time I do a Python, TypeScript, or C# project, I use it as a way to see how my overall code quality has improved. Ultimately, this blog rework was a bit of a pointless exercise. The project itself may not be valuable, but the lessons learned are valuable and immediately apply to my personal and professional work.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also never a bad thing to have too much code in your GitHub. There\u0026rsquo;s no doubt in the future, and I may run into a problem that will require a solution that I\u0026rsquo;ve already come up with.\nClosing Thoughts #I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I was going with this blog post - but if you\u0026rsquo;ve managed to make it this far, I hope it was at least somewhat interesting. If you were considering making a React blog and I\u0026rsquo;ve successfully stopped you, I will take that as a win.\nIn conclusion, don\u0026rsquo;t bother trying to make React blog, it sucks, and it\u0026rsquo;s painful to do. I\u0026rsquo;m open to changing my mind here, but for now, this will be my position.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll close this section off with a self explanatory picture as to why static page blogs kick ass.\nServer-Side Rendering Code #If you stumble across this page sometime in the future and you want to know how I set up my SSR, I\u0026rsquo;ve placed the code snippet below.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to add a disclaimer here that I do not have much familiarity with NodeJS, nor do I work in plain JavaScript very often.

I spend so much time at my computer for work and personal projects I thought it\u0026rsquo;d be a worthwhile endeavour to make something I could enjoy 12+ hours a day.\nThis post will primarily serve two purposes. I\u0026rsquo;m writing about it just for my record, and the second is to help any other would-be entrant to the hobby to outline my key learnings and share things I would\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to know before I started.\nMy Keyboard #My keyboard itself is what I\u0026rsquo;d call \u0026ldquo;semi-finished\u0026rdquo;. I purchased a lot of stuff currently sitting at the office. As I\u0026rsquo;m not allowed to return to work until the pandemic dies down a bit, I had to reorder some parts to use the keyboard in the short term. The postal service (NZ Post) also managed to make my life a living hell during this lockdown by actually losing my GMMK pro and delaying every package by weeks at a time.\nAt the time of writing, this is my setup:\nGMMK Pro Hotswappable Keyboard C3 TKC Tangerines Glorious Rainforest PBT Keycaps Durock V2 Stabilisers Durock Switch Films I’m waiting on some MT3 keycaps and some other neat stuff to bolt on this keyboard, once I eventually receive those, I’ll likely make another post.\nWhy Make a Custom Mechanical Keyboard? #Suppose you ever accidentally get suggested a custom mechanical keyboard video on YouTube. In that case, your immediate reaction will probably be something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;What the hell is this person talking about\u0026rdquo;. The hobby looks at assembling and modifying custom keyboard components to achieve a fantastic aesthetic look and sound.\nA custom mechanical keyboard is like any other luxury item; they are ultimately pointless. Just like buying a fancy watch, you get it because the aesthetics and feel of the product feel better despite having the same function as a membrane keyboard. Building a custom mechanical keyboard lets you tailor your keyboard to exactly your taste and preferences, which I think is pretty cool.\nThe Summary #I ran into a few massive hurdles straight away that made entry into the hobby a little more challenging than I expected.\nThe first one was the steep learning curve of the hobby. Being located in New Zealand meant that everything was insanely expensive or a pain in the ass to get. Lastly, anytime I watched a video, I instantly got buyers regret, cancelled my order and ordered an upgraded version of whatever I was purchasing. One of the barriers to this hobby is the culture, vocabulary, and knowledge built around the subject. As an outsider looking in, it was pretty challenging to get a base understanding of what was going on and discussed.\nMy initial reaction to the custom mechanical keyboard community is that it\u0026rsquo;s apparent that everyone who partakes in the community has a zeal about mechanical keyboards, which is very admirable. However, there is pretty abundant and conspicuous elitism in the community, which may be off-putting for some.However, the good news is that as you dive a bit deeper into the community, you find that the elitism is over represented. There have been multiple times where I\u0026rsquo;ve asked for help or advice, and I received beneficial and friendly counsel each time.\nOnce you get your head around the terminology, the mechanics of assembling and modifying a keyboard is straightforward. If you purchase a hot-swappable keyboard like me, the only thing you\u0026rsquo;ll need to learn is how to lubricate switches and stabilisers.\nThe Lingo #To cut things short, as a newbie to the subject, here are some of the key phrases that you need to know\nSwitch - These are what the keycap sits on top. Plate - The plate sits on top of the PCB. PCB - This is the actual circuit board of the keyboard. Lube - Lubricant. Don\u0026rsquo;t watch custom keyboard videos in front of your spouse, or they\u0026rsquo;ll ask you, \u0026ldquo;Why does that person keep talking about lube\u0026rdquo;. Krytox 205G0 - This is the gold standard of switch and stabiliser lubricant. It\u0026rsquo;s a viscous lubricant that you\u0026rsquo;ll be applying liberally on everything. Krytox GPL 105 - This is what you imagine when you think of lubricant. Very liquid-y, I used this to lubricate my springs. Stab / Stabiliser - Stabilisers are attachments that surround your modifiers keys and your space bar. Because these keys are big, these stabilisers provide support for those keys. KBD - KBDFans - they sell lots of keyboard stuff. PBT - PBT is a type of plastic used for keycaps. These keycaps have more of a premium feel than ABS plastic. They don\u0026rsquo;t shine over time and sound different than ABS keycaps. ABS - These are the keycaps you\u0026rsquo;ll be used to. These come standard with 99% of keyboards you can buy at a store. They shine over time and have a \u0026lsquo;wetter\u0026rsquo; feel. QMK/VIA - A type of open-source keyboard firmware that allows you to remap your keyboard easily. Hot-swappable - A type of PCB that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require soldering. You can plug your switches directly into the PCB. Films - Switch films are a plastic sheet that sits between the top and bottom housing of your switch to make the switch sound and feel better. Stem Holder - The stem of a switch is super tiny, and if you have big hands like me, they are awful to hold. A stem holder lets you clamp onto the switch and hold it. I used a mechanical pencil for my stem holder. Linear - Linear switches give you a smooth downwards press. Tactile - Tactile switches have a little bit of a bump in the middle of the end of a keypress. The typical examples you can find on store-bought keyboards would be MX Brown and Blue. Group Buys - When you’re looking for key cap sets for your keyboard you may across the term ‘group buys’. These are massive expressions of interest/preorders for things that haven’t been manufactured yet. Expect to wait for a long time if you’re doing one of these. Lubricating \u0026amp; Filming Switches # Lubricating and filming a switch improves the smoothness and the sound of the switch. The entire process took me approximately four hours; it was an incredibly tedious process, and honestly, I hated it.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t detail how to lubricate a switch as there are already some great online resources that go into these in-depth. Here is my viewing recommendation.\nThe Takeaway #Rather than explain how to lube a switch, I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share my key learnings from lubing all my switches:\nOrder spares. I broke about eight switches during the trial-and-error phase of assembling the keyboard. If you need 84, buy at least 90 to give yourself some breathing room. Do the process in batches. There are various steps in lubricating a single switch; completing each step for 10-15 switches at a time helped significantly with my consistency. Doing the entire process for a single switch one at a time made me less consistent. Over-lubing is a lot less of a risk if you have linears (as opposed to tactiles). The conventional wisdom is that you should use lube sparingly the first time you lube switches; I went ham with my lubing, and it turned out alright. If you have the disposable income, I’d seriously recommend you just to buy lubed/filmed switches from Etsy or something. With that being said, it was a cool experience overall (despite how tedious it was). Tuning the Stabilisers # Replacing the stabilisers on my GMMK Pro was honestly a bit of a nightmare. If you\u0026rsquo;ve done some pre-order reading, you\u0026rsquo;ll see many people recommend replacing the subpar factory GOAT stabilisers with Durock v2 stabilisers or something similar. You may also read that the plate doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit well when you have these stabilisers in.\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit well\u0026rdquo; is a vast understatement of how much of a pain in the ass it is to reassemble the GMMK pro with non-factory stabilisers. Frankly, the plate will not fit at all without a gentle amount of \u0026ldquo;sweaty forcing the plate onto the PCB\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Takeaway #So my advice to those who\u0026rsquo;ve purchased a GMMK Pro and decided to replace the factory stabilisers:\nIgnore that part of your brain that\u0026rsquo;s screaming, \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re breaking it!\u0026rdquo; and keep forcing that plate onto the board. Either align the top or bottom tabs, then work your way downwards or upwards. Starting in the middle will not work. Don\u0026rsquo;t panic when you see the number of tiny screws in the GMMK pro. In regards to lubing and tuning the stabilisers, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend this great video.\nFlashing QMK onto GMMK Pro on Linux #There isn’t many guides on how to use QMK with Linux so I thought I’d do a quick write up on how to do it.\npip3 install qmk qmk setup Set up will create a folder at ~/qmk_firmware. This will download all required dependencies and other things that qmk needs.\nsudo cp /home/andryo/qmk_firmware/util/udev/50-qmk.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ ## reboot after this qmk config user.keyboard=gmmk/pro/ansi qmk new-keymap vim ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/gmmk/pro/ansi/keymaps/\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;/keymap.c At this point, you’ll see something like this:\nOnce you’ve modified your keybinds to your preference, load the keyboard into bootloader mode and then run the following:\nqmk flash Closing Thoughts #That’s all the salient thoughts I had jotted down in regards to my first custom keyboard build.

So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered a scandal in the making currently brewing in the collectable gaming world. Two significant players are colluding to inflate prices, causing a bubble rapidly.\nThis post will go in-depth about the unravelling situation involving Heritage Auctions and Wata (a game grading company) and talk about the evidence in the data supporting the theory that collusion/market manipulation is occurring.\nI should be clear; this post has been written purely for educational purposes. While I\u0026rsquo;ve used data collected from Heritage Auctions, no copyright infringement is intended.\nThis article will be pretty long. If you can\u0026rsquo;t read through everything, check the \u0026quot;Key Findings\u0026quot; section for a summary of the findings.\nAs part of this mini-project, I\u0026rsquo;ve made a tool that provides a quasi-population report for any collectable game sold at Heritage Auctions, you can find this tool here. The data I\u0026rsquo;ve collected from Heritage Auctions is also freely available for anyone to use for their purposes.\nThis data is now available for anyone to use and collected as of the 5th September 2021.\nBackground #The video game collectables market has recently seen an insane increase in prices, with a copy of Super Mario 64 selling for an absurd US$1.6M. To put things into perspective, this exact copy of Super Mario 64 sold for approximately US$30K a few years ago. To reiterate, a video game that has sold 11 million times just sold for US$1.6M\u0026hellip;\nA key driving force of this insane price spike is thanks to two companies\u0026rsquo; efforts, Heritage Auctions and Wata Games. Their behaviour and actions strongly suggest that they are manipulating the market.\nWata Games \u0026amp; Heritage Auctions #Wata Games is a video gaming grading agency, a company that values an item based on its overall condition and whether it\u0026rsquo;s a loose cartridge, completed in the box, sealed, etc. In their own words, Wata Games describes their services as:\nWe have fair, objective grading standards you can count on to help assess a game\u0026rsquo;s condition and authenticity with the utmost confidence in your purchase.\nGiven Wata Game\u0026rsquo;s role in the collectable video game market, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that they significantly influence the price of collectable games. It quickly becomes alarming when you discover that a co-founder of Heritage Auctions (Jim Halperin) sits on the advisory board of Wata Games.\nJim Halperin, coincidentally, has previously been sued by the Fair Trade Commission (and was essentially fined $1.2M) for purposefully inflating the prices of collectable coins.\nKey Findings #To date, Wata Games has not released a population report. A population report is a critical piece of information that quantifies games that have been graded/assessed to a specific grade. Not releasing this information means that the overall rarity of any given video game is incredibly opaque and can lead to distortions of perceived value. To make things worse, Heritage Auctions does not release the details of buyers or sellers of listings leading to even more room for shady things to happen.\nIn my analysis of the data I collected, I think I can summarise my findings to the following points:\nRecent sales of video games at ridiculous prices have distorted the perception of video game prices. The average price of video games has been trending downwards over the last two years. These \u0026lsquo;headline\u0026rsquo; sales are extreme outliers when viewed concerning the distribution of other video game sale prices. Only a handful of games have sale prices more significant than the six-figure mark, and there is seemingly no relationship with a given video game\u0026rsquo;s overall popularity. While not definitive, the data strongly suggests that these \u0026lsquo;headline\u0026rsquo; sales are being used as a mechanism to inflate the prices of games artificially, or at the very least, the perception of said games. In conclusion, something fishy is going on here.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;ve stated at the start of the article, the data I\u0026rsquo;ve collected is available for download here.\nGame Inflation \u0026amp; Activity #If the market were genuinely surging, I\u0026rsquo;d expect that the max sale price of a collectable game would have a uniform deviation from their average price. If we look at the top ten video games with the highest deviation from their average price we find the following: If you\u0026rsquo;re at all familiar with video games, these names should be very familiar as they are either culturally iconic games, sold millions of copies, or both.\nHowever, when we look at the maximum prices of these games, we see some very striking outliers. In particular, we have three games (Super Mario 64, Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda) with extremely high sale prices compared to other games in the top ten.\nIf we plot the relationship of these ten games regarding their lifetime copies sold versus their maximum sale price, there is no clear pattern or relationship visible. Granted, the population for this visualisation is small.\nIf we look at all games sales from the available data, we can see some clear outliers. In particular, lets zone in on two of these four sales:\nSuper Mario Bros Super Mario 64 The Legend of Zelda The justification for the extreme price premium on these games is that they have some rarity element, i.e. early copies or a missing trademark.\nHowever, is this rarity precious enough to increase the prices tenfold to twentyfold the norm?\nWhether or not this scarcity truly justifies the crazy price tag, what\u0026rsquo;s certain is that comments such as \u0026quot;The last year has seen the market for retro games increase tenfold.\u0026quot; would achieve what someone attempting to manipulate the market would want to do.\nThese comments would generate the perception/news coverage that the video game collectable market is the next big thing.\nMarket Volumes \u0026amp; Trends #If we were to plot the total value of market activity on a time series and looked over the last two years, we\u0026rsquo;d see a market with an almost exponential growth curve in terms of value. This is consistent with the narrative you\u0026rsquo;d be expected to buy in, the video game market is scorching right now, and you should buy games.\nWhen we look at the distribution of sale prices, we can quickly see that the headline sales, which have caused so much enthusiasm, make an extremely small amount of total sales. A tiny fraction of total sales is between $30K and $1.6M, with \\~99% under $10K.\nIf we instead look at average prices of sales, we see the actual story. On average, video game prices have been trending downwards. If your goal is to inflate games to make a tidy profit, this is not something you want to advertise.\nFurther Reading #If you\u0026rsquo;d like more information about the key players and accusations, the following are great pieces of media:\nThis Kotaku article provides an excellent written summary. Karl Jobst\u0026rsquo;s video covering the situation covers the topic very well. If you have an hour to kill, I would recommend a watch.

However, as the elections have come and gone, it\u0026rsquo;d be sacrilege for me to pretend the goldmine of electoral data now available did not exist. In this case, my love for all things data outweighs my disdain for politics. So I thought, why not make it fun?\nIn Basketball, there is a litany of metrics which can give a different perspective on how good a player is. There are standard metrics like Points per Game, or Assists per Game which give a pretty obvious indicator of a player\u0026rsquo;s contribution to a game, and more detailed measurements such as \u0026lsquo;Offensive Rating\u0026rsquo; which are far more complex. For example, \u0026lsquo;Offensive Rating\u0026rsquo; attempts to paint an overall picture of how well a player plays offensively by not only his points contribution but things like how well he passes or how well he sets screens for a play.\nSo in the theme of treating the elections like a sport, our \u0026lsquo;plain jane\u0026rsquo; metrics would be votes received and seats gained. What about our complex or advanced metrics? What can we do to get a better idea of the \u0026lsquo;full picture\u0026rsquo;?\nNote: Please keep in mind that there are quite a few assumptions which have been made, as well as limitations of the data itself. For my methodology, approach and commentary on decisions around the underlying data, please see the end of this article.\nDonation Utilisation Efficiency #Measures which explicitly look at the return on hard-earned dollars are the norm in almost every industry; it\u0026rsquo;s natural to want to understand what you\u0026rsquo;re getting out of spending your hard-earned dollar(s). For a political party, the equivalent of money going in would be donations received from the government and their private supporters.\nNote: Political parties have to disclose what they receive in donations each year. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this data was not available for 2020. The figures discussed in this section are the sum of contributions received by each party in 2018 and 2019.\nAs a banker, I love my acronyms. Therefore I have devised a new one\u0026rsquo; Donation Utilisation Efficiency\u0026rsquo;, or DUE for short. DUE looks at the ratio of donations received per party, and the overall results achieved by the said party; this metric looks at both seats and votes acquired.\nThis metric intends to do the following:\nAct as my proxy to quantify the overall \u0026lsquo;brand power\u0026rsquo; of each party (votes) Describe how effectively they\u0026rsquo;ve translated party donations into actual power (seats) The graph is a summary of the main parties, and how well they\u0026rsquo;ve translated their donation funds into both votes and seats.\nVoter Age Demographics #Age plays a significant factor on who you would likely vote for; this is simply because your generation will dictate things like your phase in life, asset ownership or general financial security.\nThere wasn\u0026rsquo;t much that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting when seeing the results, key take-aways being:\nThe left-leaning parties (Green and Labour) have far greater representation for the younger generations (Gen X and Millenials). Conversely, the right-leaning parties, have far greater representation of the older generation. Voter Housing Demographics #The housing crisis in New Zealand is one of the most significant issues that New Zealand currently faces, so naturally, I wanted to make a graph on that too.\nThere are some interesting that instantly pop out to me when I view this data:\nLabor has a massive proportion of their voter base that do not own homes; I was incredibly surprised by this given that Labor\u0026rsquo;s position on the matter is \u0026lsquo;keep house prices as they are\u0026rsquo;. The majority of National and ACT supports own their own homes, so it feels intuitive that the housing crisis would not be as front of mind as it would be for Green/Labour supporters. Power Rankings #In the next few sections, I\u0026rsquo;ll attempt a \u0026lsquo;power ranking\u0026rsquo; of sorts of the four political parties noted.\n1. Labour #It\u0026rsquo;s not an easy feat to have a single majority in an MMP government, but Labour has done it. Regardless of how you view Labour\u0026rsquo;s policy, there\u0026rsquo;s no denying that Jacinda Ardern has been an excellent crisis leader over the last three years handling the significant incidents like the Christchurch Mosque Shootings, White Island Eruption, and now the COVID-19 pandemic very well.\nI\u0026rsquo;d say that Jacinda is more or less Labour at this point, and the DUE reflects that. The cost for Labour to influence voters and convert their relatively lesser resources into seats is significantly less than their competition.\nLabour has some significant challenges in their near future with some of the key ones being:\nHandling of the COVID19 recovery both economically and socially. Would be continued and prolonged lockdowns erode the public goodwill in the Labour\u0026rsquo; brand\u0026rsquo;? Opposition from both the right and left will likely cause additional pressure Labour did not experience in their last term. Actually dealing with the housing crisis. 80% of their voters do not own their own home; it\u0026rsquo;s a severe no brainer to deal with this if they want to retain their voting base. Labour\u0026rsquo;s position is more or less \u0026lsquo;keep the status quo\u0026rsquo; - maybe that\u0026rsquo;s just what New Zealanders want?\n2. National #It couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been easy to be the opposition to a party which had recently successfully contained a pandemic. The constant string of internal bickering, leaks and controversies also did not help.\nTheir perfect storm of missteps and misfortune has predictable results:\nRight-leaning national supports fled in droves to the likes of ACT and New Conservative. In an attempt to recover these voters, National shifted further right in their policies around tax breaks, gun control, and border control causing their more centrist supporters to shift inwards towards Labour. This resulted in National seeing a massive decline losing 21 seats between elections, long-held seats such as Ilam were lost to Labour. Despite only receiving 26% of votes, National by far has the most significant amount of donations with nearly double the next highest party. Compared to their greatest rival, National\u0026rsquo;s DUE was three times greater than Labour\u0026rsquo;s indicating it was far more challenging for them to influence voters to vote for them or rather voters were already more inclined to vote for Labour over National.ye In summary, National did bad - but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to tell you that did I?\n3. Greens #I\u0026rsquo;ve placed Greens ahead of ACT as I feel that Labour would be much more willing to deal with the Greens due to their closer ideologies.\nGreens see themselves with more seats this time around. However, they will likely no longer be part of the acting government for this electorate. Instead, I predict their role this time around will be as the opposition voice for the left.\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve had their share of missteps (ahem, James Shaw). Still, they\u0026rsquo;ve also done some notable things such as negotiating the Cannabis Referendum as part of their confidence and supply agreement, and introduction of the Zero Carbon Bill.\nAnecdotally, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that Green supporters tend to be more socially conscious younger people with decent incomes. The donations received by Greens reflect this, receiving nearly as much as Labour with a tenth of their votes. However, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily translate to an increase in votes or seats.\nTheir DUE of $5.23 per vote makes sense too. The Greens more social leaning policies such as their Wealth Tax, or previously attempted Capital Gains Tax means that their voter base is a lot more defined rather than the more centrist parties such as National or Labor. It would cost them more to convince those voters who are to the right of them to vote for Green.\nLooking at the demographics of Green supporters, their base is overwhelmingly concentrated in the younger generations (Gen Z, Millenials) and are likely not to own their own home. I expect that Greens will be a significant voice in pushing for change around the housing crisis.\n4. ACT #Wow! ACT came back with a vengeance coming in with nine extra seats than they had the previous elections. I am genuinely quite impressed at how effectively ACT has been in stealing votes from National.\nHaving only one seat in parliament last year, they managed to accomplish something significant - introducing the End of Life Choice Act.\nACT has a similar scenario to the Greens where their dedicated voter base is already defined. However, unlike the Greens, the majority of their voters are older and own their own homes. Interestingly enough, this wealthier voter base did not translate to an increase in how much donations they received. But they did better than the likes of Greens who had double the amount of donations.\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s easier to convince \u0026lsquo;gun enthusiasts\u0026rsquo; to vote for them where there is no other party who are realistically offering gun law repeals.\nI\u0026rsquo;m interested to see how ACT\u0026rsquo;s presence in our political environment will impact National in the long term. Will National continue to shift itself right to try to recapture these lost voters?\nMethodology \u0026amp; Assumptions #All sources are openly available from Stats New Zealand. If you want to do something similar, I highly encourage you to do so.\nMethodology # Meshblocks geometries were geometrically unioned by it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Statistical Area 2\u0026rsquo; (SA2) grouping. Preliminary voting locations were geolocated and then intersected with the prepared geometry above. Total votes were summed using party name, and SA2 area name. The top ten SA2 areas for each major party was chosen as a representative sample for its voter base. The metric chosen was the total amount of party votes as a percentage of total SA2 votes. The above excerpt shows this visually:\nRed is the unioned meshblock geographies grouped by SA2 area Blue represents the underlying meshblocks Yellow represents the geolocated location of a voting station Assumptions \u0026amp; Limitations # Preliminary votes have been used, this is subject to change as numbers are finalised. I\u0026rsquo;ve excluded postal votes, as well as \u0026rsquo;non-ordinary\u0026rsquo; voting places such as rest homes or prisons. I excluded these as I was not able to locate these votes to an SA2 area accurately. I\u0026rsquo;ve assumed that the voting stations represent the SA2 area which they overlap. Unfortunately, there are cases which SA2 areas do not entirely overlap Electorate areas, meaning some places would be split. To avoid any complications or misrepresentations which may arise from this, I opted to keep it simple.

This last time New Zealand was in a recession was in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. Given the current circumstances, it\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that this has occurred.\nGiven the proximity to the elections, it\u0026rsquo;s also no surprise that many political parties have taken the opportunity to blast the incumbent government for their \u0026lsquo;poor handling\u0026rsquo; of our COVID-19 response. I had a look at our recovery so far in my previous post.\nIn my opinion, many news sources and political parties have significantly mis-contextualized the extent of how significant our recession has been.\nHeadline Numbers # Recession, noun, a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters.\nThis visualization is something you may have seen frequently on the mainstream news sites. It highlights and shows our drastic fall into a recession. Without context, you\u0026rsquo;d be correct to be incredibly alarmed. U\nUnlike other countries, New Zealand could quickly return to relative normalcy, so why are we still entering a recession?\nTourism and GDP #On 19 March 2020, New Zealand closed its borders to almost all travelers, this in conjunction with our effective lockdown procedures, New Zealand got COVID-19 under control very quickly.\nThis border closure had an immediate effect, with our monthly arrivals plummeting to practically zero by the start of April. This sharp drop in overseas visitors significantly impacted New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s tourism industry, which makes up a significant proportion of its economy.\nIn FY19 international and domestic tourism contributed $40.9B of expenditure into our economy; international tourism equaled $17.162B. The indirect and direct value of tourism was quantified to be a 9.8% contribution to our GDP.\nContextualizing the Numbers #Let\u0026rsquo;s contextualize the GDP graph from our \u0026lsquo;Headline Numbers\u0026rsquo; section with the above in mind.\nIf we convert the graph from percentage to nominal terms, we can see that New Zealand GDP contracted by $922M and $7.685B for quarters one and two, respectively, this is a total of $8.067B in lost GDP.\nAt the time of writing, it has been 182 days since New Zealand closed its borders. We can pro-rata the value of FY19\u0026rsquo;s total international tourism expenditure as our proxy for what we\u0026rsquo;ve lost by international tourism in FY20. This figure is $8.557B in lost expenditure.\nI believe that our borders\u0026rsquo; closure was an essential step in getting our domestic economy to recover at the pace it has. The above graph shows that the recession New Zealand has entered was practically unavoidable.\nGiven our significant reliance on tourism, closing our borders would lead to the inevitable loss of foreign tourism.\nConclusion #It\u0026rsquo;s disappointing to see so many places do such shallow analysis of New Zealand\u0026rsquo;s recession. Whether intentionally or negligently, reporting NEW ZEALAND IN RECESSION without doing the bare minimum to explain the context will lead to unnecessary panic in a time where it is certainly not needed.\nThis post is not aiming to downplay the significance of our country entering into a recession, but more to provide a level headed and pragmatic view of it considering extenuating circumstances at a macro level.\nLastly, I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine a scenario where New Zealand does not enter into a recession during a global pandemic without seriously sacrificing its performance in managing cases. I would take the option where New Zealanders don\u0026rsquo;t die en masse over one where we all make slightly more money.\n","date":"17 September 2020","permalink":"/posts/nz-negative-growth-unbiased-analysis/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNew Zealand has officially entered into a recession after 11 years following two consecutive periods of negative GDP growth.

In particular, common properties and their payloads are evident.\nIn the below example, you\u0026rsquo;ll note that I\u0026rsquo;ve specified predefined values of which I know their values. This is due to my laziness in wanting to minimize the amount of manual work in the previous step - as I know these values are essentially static, I did not bother changing their filter values.\nimport json import os from collections import defaultdict from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs import strconv urls = [] folder = \u0026#39;har/\u0026#39; base_url = \u0026#34;https://stats.nba.com/stats/\u0026#34; for filepath in os.listdir(folder): f = open(folder + filepath) data = json.load(f) data = data.get(\u0026#39;log\u0026#39;) for entry in data[\u0026#39;entries\u0026#39;]: urls.append(entry[\u0026#39;request\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;url\u0026#39;]) endpoint_map = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(list)) predefined = { \u0026#34;LastNGames\u0026#34;: set([8, 11, 2, 6, 5, 7, 12, 14, 10, 3, 1, 9, 4, 13]), \u0026#34;Month\u0026#34;: set([8, 11, 2, 6, 5, 7, 12, 10, 1, 9, 4]), \u0026#34;SeasonSegment\u0026#34;: set([\u0026#39;Post All-Star\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Pre All-Star\u0026#39;]), \u0026#34;SeasonType\u0026#34;: set([\u0026#39;Regular Season\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;All Star\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Playoffs\u0026#39;]) } for url in urls: if \u0026#34;?\u0026#34; in url: endpoint = url.split(\u0026#39;?\u0026#39;)[0] endpoint = endpoint.split(base_url)[-1] params = parse_qs(urlparse(url).query) for key, value in params.items(): endpoint_map[endpoint][key] += value for endpoint in endpoint_map: for key, value in endpoint_map[endpoint].items(): if key in predefined: endpoint_map[endpoint][key] = predefined[key] else: endpoint_map[endpoint][key] = set(value) The steps above breakdown as follows:\nLoad the HAR file as a JSON. Grab the relevant data within the logs. Use a basic for loop to tidy the data and summarise it.

It was unfortunate because the world decided to set itself on fire due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDisclaimer: This post has comments regarding the personal investments I\u0026rsquo;ve made. This is absolutely not financial advice. If you have any questions regarding your personal circumstances, go talk to a financial advisor.\nI purposefully made the decision that I would not look at my ill-timed investments. I did not want the temptation of \u0026lsquo;panic selling\u0026rsquo; and I wanted to save myself the pain of seeing my hard-earned dollars disappear overnight. I never had any doubts that my funds would return to their starting position, it was more of a question of when it would return to their starting position.\nFund Performance as a Proxy #Recently, I was reviewing how my funds had performed over the last 6 months. It had occured to me that my two investments in FNZ and USF could serve as a proxy or an indicator of how well New Zealand has faired during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially given it\u0026rsquo;s strict and rigid lockdown measures.\nGiven that I had equally split my investment in two different funds representing the \u0026rsquo;top\u0026rsquo; of both New Zealand and the USA, it seemed like a good way to compare how detrimentally COVID-19 has impacted each economy.\nI acknowledge that this proxy has a very glaring and obvious bias which will skew the results. The bias being that COVID-19 is more likely to significantly impact smaller businesses and businesses that do not have the scale or means to absorb the financial burdens of this pandemic. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;m cognizant some industries will be significantly more impacted than others, i.e. tourism versus agriculture.\nThe above diagram is the performance of both my FNZ and USF funds, indexed to a dollar-based on the first day of my investment (4 March 2020).\nOn 23 March 2020, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, announced that New Zealand would be going into a \u0026lsquo;Level 4\u0026rsquo; lockdown from the 25th March 2020 for four weeks. This meant that all non-essential businesses and travel had to be ceased.\nThe effect of such an announcement naturally had a dramatic and significant impact on the FNZ, the dollar I had invested 19 days prior had plummeted by 31%. On 27 April 2020, New Zealand lifted its \u0026lsquo;Level 4\u0026rsquo; lockdown which meant normalcy was returning, and by 8 June 2020, normalcy had returned in the form of a \u0026lsquo;Level 1\u0026rsquo; lockdown.\nNew Zealand has handled this pandemic with great care, and have done a good job minimizing the devastating impacts it may have had. Even compared to countries with much more lax lockdown measures, the NZF rebounded at almost the same rate as the USF.\nAdditionally, due to confidence gained in how the first breakout was handled and the results gained, a second \u0026lsquo;Level 3\u0026rsquo; lockdown occurring on the 11 August 2020 did not nearly have the same impact as the first lockdown. There was a \u0026lsquo;blip\u0026rsquo; before it bounced back up a few days later.\nThe Performance That Matters #It would be foolish to look solely at economic impact alone when considering how well a country has handled a pandemic. Unlike some other countries, New Zealand had made stamping out the virus early a key priority.\nThe results of these actions are evident in the graph below.\nThere is a stark difference in the two countries which had seemingly very similar economic impacts. The difference is that at the time of writing New Zealand has a total of 1,772 cases and 24 deaths, while the USA 6.26 million cases and 188 thousand deaths.\nWhilst New Zealand has had some significant advantages in dealing with this pandemic, such as being an island nation, it does not detract from the cohesiveness and solidarity in which the country (on a whole) has dealt with COVID-19. With talks of a vaccine becoming increasingly more fervent, it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more likely that New Zealand will come out the other end of this pandemic significantly better off than other less fortunate countries.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to get fall into the doom-and-gloom and sensationalist headlines, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to step back and recognise our achievement to date - I think New Zealand has absolutely nailed its COVID-19 response.\n","date":"6 September 2020","permalink":"/posts/nz-usa-covid19/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of March, I made the unfortunate decision of investing into two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which were SmartShare\u0026rsquo;s FNZ (NZ Top 50) and USF (Fortune 500).
