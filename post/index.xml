      <description>Go Fetch! For my last few projects I&amp;rsquo;ve made the switch from Axios to plain ol&amp;rsquo; Fetch. My rationale for making this switch was:
 Axios is a third party library. Where possible I would like to reduce usage of third party libraries; and Fetch is a perfectly capable library for the purposes of building my resuable API class with.  My approach in using Fetch or Axios is to create a class which contains all my API logic.</description>

      <description>Can I See Some Identification? I&amp;rsquo;ve recently made the jump from using Django to ASP.NET Core as my primary choice when developing web applications. This was initially due to me branching into using C# for things like Unity, and later realizing how much better ASP.NET Core is than Django.
As I mostly use ReactJS for my application frontends, I did not need the &amp;lsquo;Razor&amp;rsquo; pages integrated in ASP.NET. As a result, my preference was to bootstrap my projects as webapi rather than webapp or even mvc.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;What? I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fedora 32 as my main OS for about two years. Overall, it has been a very pleasant experience and has made things such as developing much easier than it would&amp;rsquo;ve been on Windows.
However&amp;hellip; gaming on Linux is frankly a pain in the ass. No matter the state of Vulkan, Proton, Wine, etc, you&amp;rsquo;ll always find Windows games which will flat out not work. More recently, I found that Escape From Tarkov did not work at all on Linux due to Easy Anticheat.</description>
