    <h1>My First Custom Keyboard - Learnings &amp; Advice to Newbies</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>When Auckland went into lock-down in August 2021, I decided to get myself a custom keyboard after being suckered in by various videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtOX-21N1earf-K58C7HjQ">Glarses</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXlDgfWY2JbsYEam2m68Hyw">Hipyo Tech</a>.</p>
<p>I spend so much time at my computer for work and personal projects I thought it&rsquo;d be a worthwhile endeavour to make something I could enjoy 12+ hours a day.</p>
<p>This post will primarily serve two purposes. I&rsquo;m writing about it just for my record, and the second is to help any other would-be entrant to the hobby to outline my key learnings and share things I would&rsquo;ve wanted to know before I started.</p>
<h2 id="my-keyboard">My Keyboard</h2>
<p>My keyboard itself is what I&rsquo;d call &ldquo;semi-finished&rdquo;. I purchased a lot of stuff currently sitting at the office. As I&rsquo;m not allowed to return to work until the pandemic dies down a bit, I had to reorder some parts to use the keyboard in the short term. The postal service (NZ Post) also managed to make my life a living hell during this lockdown by actually losing my GMMK pro and delaying every package by weeks at a time.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/1.jpg" alt="Ahh, there it is."></p>
<p>At the time of writing, this is my setup:</p>

</ul>
<p>I’m waiting on some MT3 keycaps and some other neat stuff to bolt on this keyboard, once I eventually receive those, I’ll likely make another post.</p>
<h2 id="why-make-a-custom-mechanical-keyboard">Why Make a Custom Mechanical Keyboard?</h2>
<p>Suppose you ever accidentally get suggested a custom mechanical keyboard video on YouTube. In that case, your immediate reaction will probably be something along the lines of &ldquo;What the hell is this person talking about&rdquo;. The hobby looks at assembling and modifying custom keyboard components to achieve a fantastic aesthetic look and sound.</p>
<p>A custom mechanical keyboard is like any other luxury item; they are ultimately pointless. Just like buying a fancy watch, you get it because the aesthetics and feel of the product feel better despite having the same function as a membrane keyboard. Building a custom mechanical keyboard lets you tailor your keyboard to exactly your taste and preferences, which I think is pretty cool.</p>
<h2 id="the-summary">The Summary</h2>
<p>I ran into a few massive hurdles straight away that made entry into the hobby a little more challenging than I expected.</p>
<ol>
<li>The first one was the steep learning curve of the hobby.</li>
<li>Being located in New Zealand meant that everything was insanely expensive or a pain in the ass to get.</li>
<li>Lastly, anytime I watched a video, I instantly got buyers regret, cancelled my order and ordered an upgraded version of whatever I was purchasing.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the barriers to this hobby is the culture, vocabulary, and knowledge built around the subject. As an outsider looking in, it was pretty challenging to get a base understanding of what was going on and discussed.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to the custom mechanical keyboard community is that it&rsquo;s apparent that everyone who partakes in the community has a zeal about mechanical keyboards, which is very admirable. However, there is pretty abundant and conspicuous elitism in the community, which may be off-putting for some.However, the good news is that as you dive a bit deeper into the community, you find that the elitism is over represented. There have been multiple times where I&rsquo;ve asked for help or advice, and I received beneficial and friendly counsel each time.</p>
<p>Once you get your head around the terminology, the mechanics of assembling and modifying a keyboard is straightforward. If you purchase a hot-swappable keyboard like me, the only thing you&rsquo;ll need to learn is how to lubricate switches and stabilisers.</p>
<h3 id="the-lingo">The Lingo</h3>
<p>To cut things short, as a newbie to the subject, here are some of the key phrases that you need to know</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Switch</strong> - These are what the keycap sits on top.</li>
<li><strong>Plate</strong> - The plate sits on top of the PCB.</li>
<li><strong>PCB</strong> - This is the actual circuit board of the keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>Lube</strong> - Lubricant. Don&rsquo;t watch custom keyboard videos in front of your spouse, or they&rsquo;ll ask you, &ldquo;Why does that person keep talking about lube&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Krytox 205G0</strong> - This is the gold standard of switch and stabiliser lubricant. It&rsquo;s a viscous lubricant that you&rsquo;ll be applying liberally on everything.</li>
<li><strong>Krytox GPL 105</strong> - This is what you imagine when you think of lubricant. Very liquid-y, I used this to lubricate my springs.</li>
<li><strong>Stab / Stabiliser</strong> - Stabilisers are attachments that surround your modifiers keys and your space bar. Because these keys are big, these stabilisers provide support for those keys.</li>
<li><strong>KBD</strong> - KBDFans - they sell lots of keyboard stuff.</li>
<li><strong>PBT</strong> - PBT is a type of plastic used for keycaps. These keycaps have more of a premium feel than ABS plastic. They don&rsquo;t shine over time and sound different than ABS keycaps.</li>
<li><strong>ABS</strong> - These are the keycaps you&rsquo;ll be used to. These come standard with 99% of keyboards you can buy at a store. They shine over time and have a &lsquo;wetter&rsquo; feel.</li>
<li><strong>QMK/VIA</strong> - A type of open-source keyboard firmware that allows you to remap your keyboard easily.</li>
<li><strong>Hot-swappable</strong> - A type of PCB that doesn&rsquo;t require soldering. You can plug your switches directly into the PCB.</li>
<li><strong>Films</strong> - Switch films are a plastic sheet that sits between the top and bottom housing of your switch to make the switch sound and feel better.</li>
<li><strong>Stem Holder</strong> - The stem of a switch is super tiny, and if you have big hands like me, they are awful to hold. A stem holder lets you clamp onto the switch and hold it. I used a mechanical pencil for my stem holder.</li>
<li><strong>Linear</strong> - Linear switches give you a smooth downwards press.</li>
<li><strong>Tactile</strong> - Tactile switches have a little bit of a bump in the middle of the end of a keypress. The typical examples you can find on store-bought keyboards would be MX Brown and Blue.</li>
<li><strong>Group Buys</strong> - When you’re looking for key cap sets for your keyboard you may across the term ‘group buys’. These are massive expressions of interest/preorders for things that haven’t been manufactured yet. Expect to wait for a long time if you’re doing one of these.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lubricating--filming-switches">Lubricating &amp; Filming Switches</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/2.jpg" alt="Calm before the storm."></p>
<p>Lubricating and filming a switch improves the smoothness and the sound of the switch. The entire process took me approximately four hours; it was an incredibly tedious process, and honestly, I hated it.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t detail how to lubricate a switch as there are already some great online resources that go into these in-depth. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44Wv4OGdmu4">Here is my viewing recommendation</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/3.jpg" alt="Switches successfully lubed."></p>
<h3 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h3>
<p>Rather than explain how to lube a switch, I thought I&rsquo;d share my key learnings from lubing all my switches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order spares. I broke about eight switches during the trial-and-error phase of assembling the keyboard. If you need 84, buy at least 90 to give yourself some breathing room.</li>
<li>Do the process in batches. There are various steps in lubricating a single switch; completing each step for 10-15 switches at a time helped significantly with my consistency. Doing the entire process for a single switch one at a time made me less consistent.</li>
<li>Over-lubing is a lot less of a risk if you have linears (as opposed to tactiles). The conventional wisdom is that you should use lube sparingly the first time you lube switches; I went ham with my lubing, and it turned out alright.</li>
<li>If you have the disposable income, I’d seriously recommend you just to buy lubed/filmed switches from Etsy or something. With that being said, it was a cool experience overall (despite how tedious it was).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/4.jpg" alt="Here&rsquo;s how you orient the film and stem."></p>
<h2 id="tuning-the-stabilisers">Tuning the Stabilisers</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/5.jpg" alt="Stabilisers in disarray on my desk."></p>
<p>Replacing the stabilisers on my GMMK Pro was honestly a bit of a nightmare. If you&rsquo;ve done some pre-order reading, you&rsquo;ll see many people recommend replacing the subpar factory GOAT stabilisers with Durock v2 stabilisers or something similar. You may also read that the plate doesn&rsquo;t fit well when you have these stabilisers in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t fit well&rdquo; is a vast understatement of how much of a pain in the ass it is to reassemble the GMMK pro with non-factory stabilisers. Frankly, the plate will not fit at all without a gentle amount of &ldquo;sweaty forcing the plate onto the PCB&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/7.jpg" alt="Even looking at the screws in the picture gives me anxiety"></p>
<h3 id="the-takeaway-1">The Takeaway</h3>
<p>So my advice to those who&rsquo;ve purchased a GMMK Pro and decided to replace the factory stabilisers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore that part of your brain that&rsquo;s screaming, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re breaking it!&rdquo; and keep forcing that plate onto the board.</li>
<li>Either align the top or bottom tabs, then work your way downwards or upwards. Starting in the middle will not work.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t panic when you see the number of tiny screws in the GMMK pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to lubing and tuning the stabilisers, I&rsquo;d recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usNx1_d0HbQ">this great video</a>.</p>
<h2 id="flashing-qmk-onto-gmmk-pro-on-linux">Flashing QMK onto GMMK Pro on Linux</h2>
<p>There isn’t many guides on how to use QMK with Linux so I thought I’d do a quick write up on how to do it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">pip3 install qmk
qmk setup
</code></pre></div><p>Set up will create a folder at <code>~/qmk_firmware</code>.  This will download all required dependencies and other things that qmk needs.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo cp /home/andryo/qmk_firmware/util/udev/50-qmk.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/ <span style="color:#75715e">## reboot after this</span>
qmk config user.keyboard<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>gmmk/pro/ansi
qmk new-keymap
vim ~/qmk_firmware/keyboards/gmmk/pro/ansi/keymaps/&lt;name&gt;/keymap.c
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, you’ll see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://mrzk.io/images/keyboard/79.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you’ve modified your keybinds to your preference, load the keyboard into bootloader mode and then run the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">qmk flash
</code></pre></div><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>That’s all the salient thoughts I had jotted down in regards to my first custom keyboard build. Overall, I really enjoyed it and can’t wait to do it again. My wife wants a custom keyboard now so I have the excuse to build another fairly soon.</p>
<p>I hope for those who stumble across this post, I hope the information provided has been useful.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
