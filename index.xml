      <title>ASP.NET Core Web API JWT Implementation</title>

      <description>Sir, can I see your ID? I&amp;rsquo;ve recently made the jump from using Django to ASP.NET Core as my primary choice when developing web applications. This was initially due to me branching into using C# for things like Unity, and later realizing how much enjoyable it was to use ASP.NET Core over Django.
As I mostly use ReactJS for my application frontends, I did not need the &amp;lsquo;Razor&amp;rsquo; pages integrated in ASP.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;What? I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fedora 32 as my main OS for about two years. Overall, it has been a very pleasant experience and has made things such as developing much easier than it would&amp;rsquo;ve been on Windows.
However&amp;hellip; gaming on Linux is frankly a pain in the ass. No matter the state of Vulkan, Proton, Wine, etc, you&amp;rsquo;ll always find Windows games which will flat out not work. More recently, I found that Escape From Tarkov did not work at all on Linux due to Easy Anticheat.</description>
