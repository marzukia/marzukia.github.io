      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m not the greatest fan of politics, in a typical scenario I&amp;rsquo;d avoid talking about it like the plague. However, as the elections have come and gone, it&amp;rsquo;d be sacrilege for me to pretend the goldmine of electoral data now available did not exist.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of March, I made the unfortunate decision of investing into two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which were SmartShare&amp;rsquo;s FNZ (NZ Top 50) and USF (Fortune 500). It was unfortunate because the world decided to set itself on fire due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <description>ReactJS is an awesome library to use for frontends. It&amp;rsquo;s super fast to use when you want to get a really interactive and intuitive application up and running.
ReactJS comes prepackaged with its own way to manage state locally within a component.</description>

      <description>When I started learning and using Python 2 years ago, I had no real previous experience of coding under my belt. I had done some small projects in HTML and PHP a very longtime ago, but that experience was certainly no longer helpful.</description>

      <description>Have you ever heard of a genetic algorithm?
In the context of sexual reproduction, an offspring inherits half of it&amp;rsquo;s mother&amp;rsquo;s genes and half of it&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s genes. The inheritance of genes occurs completely randomly, the offspring&amp;rsquo;s genes are a random mixture of it&amp;rsquo;s two parents.</description>

      <guid>https://marzukia.github.io/post/using-fetch-over-axios-in-reactjs-applications/</guid>
      <description>For my last few projects I&amp;rsquo;ve made the switch from Axios to plain ol&amp;rsquo; Fetch. My rationale for making this switch was:
 Axios is a third party library. Where possible I would like to reduce usage of third party libraries; and Fetch is a perfectly capable library for the purposes of building my resuable API class with.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fedora 32 as my main OS for about two years. Overall, it has been a very pleasant experience and has made things such as developing much easier than it would&amp;rsquo;ve been on Windows.</description>
