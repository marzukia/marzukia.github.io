      <title>Vaccinations Matter (aka Why Anti-Vaxxers Should Really Reconsider)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few things frustrate me more than seeing anti-lockdown protestors, anti-vaxxers, or those who believe that vaccines somehow infringe upon their personal freedoms. The value of vaccination should be self-evident to anyone with even a shred of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not often that three of my interests mash intersect together, in this case, my love of video games, data and technology. So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered a scandal in the making currently brewing in the collectable gaming world. Two significant players are colluding to inflate prices, causing a bubble rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m not the greatest fan of politics, in a typical scenario I&amp;rsquo;d avoid talking about it like the plague. However, as the elections have come and gone, it&amp;rsquo;d be sacrilege for me to pretend the goldmine of electoral data now available did not exist. In this case, my love for all things data outweighs my disdain for politics. So I thought, why not make it fun?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has officially entered into a recession after 11 years following two consecutive periods of negative GDP growth. This last time New Zealand was in a recession was in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. Given the current circumstances, it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that this has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Well Has New Zealand Handled COVID-19?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of March, I made the unfortunate decision of investing into two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which were SmartShare&amp;rsquo;s FNZ (NZ Top 50) and USF (Fortune 500). It was unfortunate because the world decided to set itself on fire due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
