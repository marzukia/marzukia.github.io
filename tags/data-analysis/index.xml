      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest; I get excessively irritated when I see anti-lockdown protestors, anti-vaxxers, or those who have some distorted notion that vaccines (and having to get one) somehow undermine their freedom.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that three of my interests mash intersect together, in this case, my love of video games, data and technology. So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered a scandal in the making currently brewing in the collectable gaming world.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m not the greatest fan of politics, in a typical scenario I&amp;rsquo;d avoid talking about it like the plague.

      <description>At the beginning of March, I made the unfortunate decision of investing into two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which were SmartShare&amp;rsquo;s FNZ (NZ Top 50) and USF (Fortune 500).
